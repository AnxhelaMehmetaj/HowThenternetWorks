                            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff,
                            and the public work together to develop Web standards.
                            Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.
                           <h5>MISSION</h5>
                            The W3C mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.
                            <h5>Vision</h5>
                            W3C's vision for the Web involves participation, sharing knowledge, and thereby building trust on a global scale.
                            <h5>Process</h5>
                            Most W3C work revolves around the standardization of Web technologies. To accomplish this work, W3C follows processes that promote the development of high-quality standards based on community consensus; an introduction to the W3C Process gives a sense of how W3C gets work done. All stakeholders can have a voice in the development of W3C standards,
                            including Members large and small, as well as the public. W3C processes promote fairness, responsiveness, and progress: all facets of the W3C mission.

                            <h4>HTML</h4>
                            HTML stands for HyperText Markedup Language. A text of a web page is included directly in the HTML but other parts like Images or videos,
                            are separate files with their own URLs that need to be requested. The browser sends separate HTTP requests for each of them and and dispay them as they arrive
                            If a web page has a lot of different images, each of them causes a separate HTTP request and the page loads slower.
                            Not only we are requesting pages with GET requests, but also sometimes we send information like when we fill out a form. Browser send
                            this information as a plain text to the web server using an HTTP POST request.
                            <h4>Steps</h4>

                                <li>Login Tumblr (this means send POST requests that hase some data like username and password).</li>
                            <li>This does to Tumblr server and send back success. LOGGED IN </li>
                            <li>Along with web page there are some invisible cookie data tha browser sees.</li>
                                <li>Cookes (what websites use to remember who you are) and inside the cookies is an ID card that identifies you.  </li>

                            <h4> Secure website</h4>
                            To prevent website from snooping & Tampering using something called Secure Socket Layer and its successor Transport Layer Security.
                            SSL And TSL are active when the little lack appears in  web Browser address next to HTTPS.
                            SSL is a digital certificate which is like an official ID card just like government issues IDs or passports.

                            Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                            written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                            This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file
                            to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
