            Sending an image to your friend or upload to a website,that is made up of billions of bits 0s and 1s, too many to send along in
            one packet. The computer sending the image can break it into smaller parts called packets. Each packet has the internet
            address of where it came from and where it's going. Routers act like traffic managers to keep the packets moving through the networks smoothly.

                                All the different devices on the internet have unique addresses. An address on the Internet
                                is just a number like the phone number, that's unique to each computer or device.the
                                most important protocols used in internet communication simply called the ip(internet protocols).
                                A computer address is called its ip address. Visiting a website is really just your
                                computer asking the other computer for information. Your computer sends a message to the
                                other computerâ€™s IP address and it also sends along its origin address, so the  other
                                pc knows where to send its response. IP addresses are just a bunch of numbers that are
                                organized in hierarchy. These numbers are represented in bits.  Traditional ip addresses
                                are 32 bits long with 8 bits for each part of the addresses.the earlier number identifies
                                the country and regional network of the device. And then subnetwork and finally the address
                                of the specific device.

                                The way information is transferred from one computer to another is pretty interesting.
                                Information goes from one computer to another in what we call a packet of information and
                                a packet travels from one place to another on the internet a lot like how you might get from
                                one place to another in a car. depending on traffic congestion you may choose a different route to get to the same place.
                                Digital Information can be sent with ip packets but there are some limits.Each packet has the internet
                                address of where it came from and where it's going.

                                Routers act like traffic managers to keep the packets moving through the networks. If one route is congested, individuals
                                packets may travel different routes through the Internet and arrive to the destination at slightly different time and out of order.
                                Every router keeps track of multiple paths for sending packets, and it chooses the cheapest available path for each piece of data
                                based on destination ip address for the packet. Network can keep sending packets even if somethings goes wrong. This is the basic for a
                                key principle of the Internet:Reliability.
