                <h4>HTTP</h4>
                    Computer starts talking to a server and ask for a website and that server starts to talk back to your computer in a language called HTTP. HTTP stands for HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOLS. This is the language that computer uses to ask another computer for a document
                    If you were to intercept the conversation between your computer and a web server on the internet, it's made up of something called "GET" requests.
                <h4>What is HTTP?</h4>
                HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. When you enter http:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it
                tells the browser to connect over HTTP. HTTP uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), generally over port 80, to send and
                receive data packets over the web. To put it simply it is a protocol that's used by a client and server which allows you to communicate
                with other websites. The client sends a request message to an HTTP server (after the TCP handshake) which hosts a website,
                the server then replies with the response message.

                <h4>What is HTTPS?</h4>

                HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (also referred to as HTTP over TLS or HTTP over SSL).
                When you enter https:// in your address bar in front of the domain, it tells the browser to connect over HTTPS.
                Generally sites running over HTTPS will have a redirect in place so even if you type in http:// it will redirect to deliver
                over a secured connection. HTTPS also uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to send and receive data packets, but
                it does so over port 443, within a connection encrypted by Transport Layer Security (TLS).
                Well HTTPS was actually created by Netscape Communications back in 1994 to use in its Netscape Navigator web browser.
                HTTPS originally used the SSL protocol which eventually evolved into TLS
                HTTPS transmits its data security using an encrypted connection. Basically it uses a public key which is then decrypted on the recipient side. The public key is deployed on the server,
                and included in what you know as an SSL certificate. The certificates are cryptographically signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).

                <h4>The Internet: Encryption & Public Keys</h4>
                Encryption is the process of scrambling or changing messages to hide the original text.
                Decryption is the process of un-scrambling that message to make it readable.
                Today's secure communications are encrypted using 256 bit keys.
                ASYMMETRIC KEY- A public key that can be exchanged with anybody and a private key that is not shared. The public key is used to encrypt data
                and anybody can use it to create a message, but the secret can only decrypted by a computer with access to the private key.
